# Distributed Algorithms and Systems
## RMI in Java
You must be able to produce code in Java using RMI which creates a simple distributed system.
Generally you need:
* Interface on Server
* Implementing Class
* Main Class that puts object into registry
* Client Main Class

... and for callbacks ...

* Interface on Client
* Implementing Class
* Data Structure on server to store clients to callback to

## RPC
* BLAST
* CHAN
* SELECT

## Distributed Objects & RMI
* Remote Method Invocation
* Remote Object References
* Remote Interfaces
* Middleware Objects
 * Proxy
 * Dispatcher
 * Skeleton

## Transactions and Concurrency Control

## Coordination and Agreement

## Time Synchronisation and Event Ordering
* Drift
* External Sync, Internal Sync
* Cristian's Simple Method for Sychronising Clock with Time Server
  * Main Assumptions
  * Bounds with Minimum Transmission Time
* Network Time Protocol (NTP)
